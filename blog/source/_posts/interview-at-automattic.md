The interview process at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/about/) is little bit different than traditional SE interview process you find all over the world.
The whole process is async, and it is long (a couple of months) and can be tedious.

The official process can be [found here](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/). This is my story.

### Background
I became interested to look for full-remote roles after reading [this blog post](https://modasserbillah.ml/2020/09/07/going-remote/) from a fellow countryman.

### Application
I applied [online](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/) for a Senior Software Engineer role. A couple of days later, a recruiter reached out over email.
They asked me to pick a time slot for a 90-minute text-only interview. Once I picked a slot, a meeting was scheduled and I was added to the Slack workspace. I was added to a dedicated slack channel for my interview. My interviewer and a few HR folks were added to the channel at the same time. They dropped a few links in there for me to read at my leisure. 

### Technical interview
On the scheduled day I sat for a 90-minute text-only interview.
This was a slack conversation with another engineer.
It's based on various topics you typically talk about on the screening interview like my background, my interests, philosophies, etc.
For example, we talked about a complex bug I had encountered and how I ran troubleshooting, and how I fixed it.
The conversation was pretty much based on the typical day-to-day job of a SE like unit testing and CI/CD etc.
I had sat on the other side of the table many times for NewsCred, and I could tell I was doing well.

After a few days, my recruiter got back to me (on Slack) and confirmed the next steps.

### Code test
For the next step, I was invited to a Github org for a code test.
I had to fulfill some objectives in a repo (an unknown toy codebase).
I was given an online editor so that I don't have to set up anything locally (tho I coded locally in the end and pushed frequently to see the changes live).

I hadn't written PHP in a while, but I was told not to worry about the programming language.
I had to write a bit of PHP and JS code and add unit tests and then opened a Pull Request after 2 or 3 days.

An engineer reviewed the PR and left feedback.
They even did QA and gave feedback that I missed a bug. I worked on that for another couple of days and fixed it.
This time around, they were happy with the results and gave me a green signal for the next round.

This is not paid project and took about a week to finish.

The codebase was not super clean but I think it is an example of how all code tests should be.
People should not ask candidates to build something from scratch, rather provide them with the base and ask them to add/fix/improve on that.

### The Trial
The trial is the most important part of this process.
Again I had to fulfill objectives in yet another unknown toy codebase, this time a much larger repo.
I was assigned a trial buddy (who would act as a Product Manager), I was given full freedom on how I wanted to implement the objective.

I would incrementally make progress each week and ask for code review on an open PR.
An engineer (the trial buddy) would review the pull request and leave questions and feedback.
Same as the code test, my coding styles, unit testing, git commit messages, etc were under the microscope.

Another important part of the trial is to evaluate how I was communicating.
I was asked to leave a cumulative update every week (in an internal blogging tool named P2), on how I am approaching the problem each day so my reviewer would know my thought process.
It was also important for my recruiter to see how I was communicating with my trial buddy (over Slack, Github, and P2) to determine if I would be a good fit.

The trial involved reading a lot of legacy code.
I also had to make some architectural decisions and had to document them in the P2 blog.

This part was paid. It took around four weeks to finish (people usually do it in about six weeks).
With this passed, you are sure to receive an offer.
  
### Informal chat with DevEx team
This one was a video call. We talked about my interests to find the right team for me.

  
### Offer from HR
This was another slack chat. We negotiated terms.
