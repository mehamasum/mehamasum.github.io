Now you wish to “log” every request it receives. So you put a middleware in between the code of receiving a request and generating a response that will log the request.</p>\n<p>But why would you put a middleware there? Can’t you just log the request “in-place”? Like this?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">function getResponse(request) {\n    ...\n    log(request)\n    ...\n    return generateResponse(request)\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Of course you can do that.<br>\nBut what if you have so many of these functions that get the request and generate a response (for example each of them get the request from a different url path). So would you handle it like this?  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">function getResponseForLoginRequest(request) {\n    ...\n    log(request)\n    ...\n    return generateResponseForLoginRequest(request.data.username, request.data.password)\n}\n\nfunction getResponseForLogoutRequest(request) {\n    ...\n    log(request)\n    ...\n    return generateResponseForLogoutRequest(request.data.username)\n}\n\n...\n...\n...</code></pre></div>\n<p>The best feature of middleware is that it’s composable in a chain. You can use multiple independent third-party middleware in a single project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lets know middlewares better","date":"December 21, 2018","tags":["middlewares","reduxjs","expressjs","django"],"category":"Tech","thumbnail":"/images/meta/favicon.png","spoiler":"Lessons learned from writing middlewares."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018/12/dear-middlewares/","previousPage":{"id":"72543fad-6406-5c70-aa50-fcf32ae57fe5","excerpt":"Wow!
